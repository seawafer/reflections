When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

* to avoid losing my local repository in case my laptop is damaged or stolen.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

* to avoid having my local copy updated while I'm busy doing more original work

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. 

* fork: clones between two github repos
* clones: getting a local copy of the github repository
* branch: creating another track of the project

When would you use one instead of another?

* fork when you're cloning a github repo to github repo
* clone when you're cloning github repo to local
* branch when you're creating a new track of the project

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

* to keep working on a recent version of the code and avoid conflicts.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?
What would be easier, and what would be harder?

* Sending updated project files manually and versioning them by hand.
* Finding out the changes between different versions will be hard without
git/github
