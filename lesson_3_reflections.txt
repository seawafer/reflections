When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

* to avoid losing my local repository in case my laptop is damaged or stolen.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

* to avoid having my local copy updated while I'm busy doing more original work
