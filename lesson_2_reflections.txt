What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

* a .git directory is created after git init and it's necessary to run git init
to convert the normal directory into a git repo.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

* staging area is a dynamic working directory where you can see the modified
files before adding them to the repository.

* it allows you to select specific changes to add to the repo and keep some 
other changes for later.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

* "git diff --staged" to see what you're about to commit
