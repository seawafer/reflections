How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

* It was very helpful to find the differences indeed.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more 
efficient programmer in the long term?

* maybe it the full change history of a file will help finding a bug easier

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
Docs does?

Pros
* More control over what to commit and what not to commit
* More control over the size of the commit
Cons
* Can be forgotten

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

* some files maybe related to each other so they have to be saved together
* text documents are in general standalone so it's safe to save them separately


How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

* git log --stat
* git diff old-commit new-commit

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

* very likely because I can always revert to a working version

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

* starting doing small projects
